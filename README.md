# PrevaCare Homepage üè•

Hey there! üëã I built this awesome homepage for PrevaCare - a healthcare platform that's all about keeping people healthy before they get sick.

## What's This About?

It's a modern, responsive React website that looks great on everything from phones to big desktop screens. The whole idea is to show how PrevaCare helps companies take better care of their employees with preventive healthcare.

## Cool Features ‚ú®

- **Smooth animations** that trigger as you scroll - makes browsing feel super nice
- **Video background** in the hero section for that wow factor
- **Interactive workflow** showing how their 5-step health model works
- **Calendly integration** so people can book demos right from the site
- **Contact forms** with sweet popup notifications when you submit
- **Mobile-friendly** - works perfectly on phones with a hamburger menu and everything

## How to Use This

1. Clone it down:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jia2005/Preva.git
   cd prevacare-homepage
   ```

2. Install the good stuff:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm install lucide-react sweetalert2
   ```

3. Fire it up:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Check it out at `http://localhost:3000`

That's it! The site should load up with all the animations and everything working smoothly.

## Quick Customization

- Swap out the Calendly URL in the iframe to use your own booking link
- Update the logo and video files in the Media folder
- Change colors by tweaking the Tailwind classes throughout the component
